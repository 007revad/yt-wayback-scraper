The Youtube Wayback Scraper is an app for the yt-dlp fork that enables the retrieval of deleted Youtube videos, if they are present on the Wayback Machine.

Using the app is pretty straight forward. 

Choose the directory that you would like the downloaded videos to be saved to.

Enter the url of a deleted YouTube video, or a YouTube playlist that contains deleted videos.

You may either instantly save all of the found videos instantly by checking the designated box, or you can choose which videos you would like to keep.

If you choose the later option, press the submit button and wait as the videos are searched.

The names and IDs of the videos that are found will be displayed in the box. You can select the ones you want or download them all.

Your downloaded videos will be stored in the folder you chose.

That's it! You're done!
